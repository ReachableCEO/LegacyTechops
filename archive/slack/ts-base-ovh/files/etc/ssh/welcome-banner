Hello Trender.

IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT THIS VIRTUAL MACHINE!! 
                                                           
 This virtual machine is considered expendable therefore   
 it is not backed up. Your home directory (/home) however, 
 is backed up so please store data you do not wish to lose 
 there. The lab team will make a best effort attempt to     
 troubleshoot virtual machine issues and will re-deploy     
 the VM if issues are not easily resolved. Any questions   
 should be directed to tplabsupport@trendmicro.com
